Robotic Arm User Manual
Introduction
This manual will guide you step-by-step on how to use your Arduino-controlled robotic arm. Please read all instructions before operating the device.

Main Components
Robotic Arm: Includes 5 servos (Base, Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist, Gripper).

Right Joystick: Controls the Base and Shoulder.

Left Joystick: Controls the Elbow and Wrist.

Dead Man's Switch: Must be pressed at all times for the device to operate.

Gripper-Close Button: Closes the gripper.

Gripper-Open Button: Opens the gripper.

Emergency Button: Stops all operations immediately.

LEDs: Status indicators (Green, Yellow, Red).

Buzzer: Emits alert sounds.

Usage Instructions
1. Initial Setup
Positioning: Place the robotic arm on a flat and stable surface.

Connections: Ensure all components are connected correctly.

Servos should be connected to their respective pins.

Joysticks should be connected to the analog pins.

Buttons should be connected with pull-down resistors.

LEDs and Buzzer should be connected as per the wiring diagram.

2. Powering Up the System
Power: Connect the Arduino to a power source (via USB or external battery).

Green LED: The green LED should light up indicating the system is ready to operate.

3. Operating the Robotic Arm
Press the Dead Man's Switch: The system will only function while the switch is pressed.

If the switch is released, all movements will be blocked for 30 seconds.

Controlling the Base and Shoulder: Use the right joystick.

X-axis movement controls the Base.

Y-axis movement controls the Shoulder.

Controlling the Elbow and Wrist: Use the left joystick.

X-axis movement controls the Elbow.

Y-axis movement controls the Wrist.

Closing the Gripper: Press the Gripper-Close button.

Lock Alert: If the gripper doesn't move for 300 ms, the buzzer will sound.

Opening the Gripper: Press the Gripper-Open button.

Lock Alert: If the gripper doesn't move for 300 ms, the buzzer will sound.

4. Safety Mode
Power Check: The system continuously checks voltage and current.

Red LED: If voltage is below 5V, the red LED will light up.

Safety Mode: If power is insufficient, the system operates one servo at a time.

Yellow LED: Indicates the system is in safety mode.

5. Emergency
Press the Emergency Button: Immediately stops all operations.

Release the button to reset the system after 30 seconds.

Maintenance
Regular Inspection: Periodically check connections and components.

Calibration: Recalibrate the servos as needed.

Precautions
Supervision: Always operate the robotic arm under supervision.

Power: Use a stable and appropriate power source.

Safe Environment: Keep the device away from small children and pets.
